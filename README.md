Although IPv6 has been around since 1998, some big parts of the internet are IPv4 only. Since World IPv6 Launch day on June 6 2012 the global IPv6 traffic has grown more than 500%. However, the adoption at major websites is still bad even though they should have the money, time and people to provide IPv6 connectivity.

This repository contains code to check some website domains for AAAA records using multipe public available DNS resolvers and generate a static website containing the results.
